Please devote 4 hours to the following task.

## Challenge

Create a ping pong bracket which keeps track of who is the current office champion at ping pong.  

## Requirements

1. Allow players to register and login
2. Allow a player to view the ping pong bracket rankings in the office
3. Allow a player to log the result of a series of games (time played, score of each game).
4. Allow a player to view their ping pong results history
5. Allow a player to customize their name and password and any other properties

Games are inputted on the honor system. 

## Games

Games follow standard ping pong rules.  They are games to 21, which need to be won by a two point margin. 

## Leaderboard

Please design how the algorithm for how a fair leaderboard should work.  Please feel free to consult any refernece that you like. 

Please keep in mind the following factors:

1. Not all wins should count the same. eg. a player ranked 4 beating a player ranked 5 should not count the same as a player ranked 5 beating a player ranked 1. 
2. When the leaderboard is first created all the users will be equal in ranking

## App

Please add all necessary models, controllers, gems and tests. The UI is totally up to you.  Feel free to use bootstrap or any other framework.

## Evaluation criteria

We are evaluating you as a backend ruby developer so we are most interested in evaluating the following:

1. Can you complete the assignment as tasked? 
2. Can you create a clean architecture?
3. Is your code tested?
4. Can you walk through your code and explain how it works? 

## Bonus points

You get bonus points for the following:

1. Deploying the app to a host (ideally heroku)
2. Integration with Gravatator (headshot)
3. Consideration in the leaderboard for time away from the office and winning streaks
4. A handshaking process for approving the score of a game

## Completion

Please upload your code to a public repository and send me a link when it is ready.
